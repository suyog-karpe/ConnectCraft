# ConnectCraft
Phase 1 and Phase 2 Completed 
Providing Optimal Network and predicting Network Connectivity with the help of AI and integration in real-time.(For determining which Network i.e:Idea, Airtel,Jio is better according to their location-based services and providing them to users directly via our application. 
Making sure users experience is embarking on a more connected, productive, and satisfying digital experience.
This is truly possible with the help of machine learning algorithms and determining which one truly determines the accuracy comparing them and providing an optimal network.
This also has helped with network prediction for future through historical and real time data fed through our speed tests in the application itself.
